# Xccelerate Full-time Data Science- October 2018

## Projects
* Beginner Machine Learning: Prediction Hong Kong Property Prices ([pitch](https://gitpitch.com/ohjho/ftds_oct_2018/master?p=Projects/BeginnerDataScience), [ipynb](Projects/BeginnerDataScience))
    * **Disclaimer**: this project is only ~70% finished. Because [done is better than perfect](https://www.fastcompany.com/3001533/truth-about-being-done-versus-being-perfect), so I guess this is at least somewhat good.
    * partnered with **[@domsoon88](https://github.com/domsoon88)**: [link to his repo](https://github.com/domsoon88/Centaline)
    * and **[@tomfischersz](https://github.com/tomfischersz)**
