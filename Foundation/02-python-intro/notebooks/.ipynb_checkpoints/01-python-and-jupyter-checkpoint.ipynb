Along with it's popularity comes a large community, this means that there are many open source libraries to solve a wide varitey of problems. In particular python has brilliant libraries for data science and machine learning, and is probably the most popular langauge used in these fields. Its popularity means debugging is considerably easier, since any problem you have encontered is likely to already be on stackoverflow (a popular programming forum). A recent [post](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) from stackoverflow predicts it's popularity to only continue growing.\n",
