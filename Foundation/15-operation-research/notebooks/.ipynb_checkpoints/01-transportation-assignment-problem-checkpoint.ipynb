    "Powerco has three electric power plants that supply the needs of four cities. Each power plant can supply the following numbers of kilowatt-hours (kwh) of electricity: plant 1 – 35 million; plant 2 – 50 million; plant 3 – 40 million. The peak power demands in these cities, which occur at the same time (2 p.m.), are as follows (in kwh): city 1 – 45 million; city 2 – 20 million; city 3 – 30 million; city 4 – 30 million. The costs of sending 1 million kwh of electricity from plant to city depend on the distance the electricity must travel. Formulate an LP to minimize the cost of meeting each city’s peak power demand.\n",
