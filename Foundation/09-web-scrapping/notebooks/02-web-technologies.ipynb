Open up chrome webtools and click on the network tab.\n",

    "Have you every wondered why you can log in once to Facebook and then always return without having to log in again? Cookies is the magic word here. Cookies are unique identifiers send by the server and stored in the users browser. They are then passed along with every request to the server, making it possible to uniquely identify a user. Without cookies a user remains pretty much anonymous. Imagine that, with every request you receive you have dynamically return data but have no way of identifying the requesting party, many applications couldnâ€™t work the way they currently do. Cookies are therefore essential.\n",

    "# SPA\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently in web design there has been a move towards SPAs (single page apps), these are websites that load a single html page and then dynamically update the page as the user interacts with it.  When the user interactives with the page they trigger javascript code which is used to fetch data/send data via AJAX or modify the pages layout.  Single Page Apps are tricker to scrape since when we request the HTML page the data that we want has yet to be fetched. In order to fetch the data we must use code to click on the relevant part of the application. We can achieve this by clicking on elements using splash scripts. "
