    "A`<style>` tag can be used to contain CSS which allows us to apply different styling to the html. For illustrative purposes I put the CSS inside the style tag but usally it is within a seperate file called a stylesheet and linked to the html document using a `<link>` tag. Class attribtutes can be reused to apply the same styles to many elements. This is in contrast to id attributes which should be used on a single element. Notice that in CSS classes start with a dot e.g `.classname` , whereas ID's start with a hashtag e.g `#myid`. More on CSS later."

    "\n",
    "CSS Selectors are little lanaguge to specify which html element we wish to select.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Element Selectorss \n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic css selectors simply the name of the element that you would like to select. For example bellow the css selector would select all `p` tags and colour them red.\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "p {\n",
    "color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descendant Selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Descendant selectors can be used to selected elements within other elements. For example the css bellow would select all `li` elements contained within  a `ul` \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ul li {\n",
    "border-bottom: 1px gray solid;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes start with a dot **`.`** and can be used to select elements that have that class as an attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "```.green\n",
    ".spaghetti {\n",
    "background-color: green;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "### IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "IDs start with a hash tag # and are used to apply a css style to a unique element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "#fusilli {\n",
    "background-color: yellow;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chained Selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "When using classes we can chain selectors together. For example the selector bellow would select all elements that have both the `.spaghetti` and `.penne` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    ".spaghetti.penne {\n",
    "background: blue;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more ways to write CSS selectors so I won't continue to list them all here but hopefully you get the point. To learn the other ways I suggest you use a [cheatsheet](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).\n"

JavaScript support is built right into all the major web browsers, and each browser has a JS console. For a brief overview of the langauge see [javascript in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/).
