    "Linear algebra covers a wide range of topics ranging from vectors and matrices, determinants, system of linear equations, eigenvalue and eigen-vector, linear transformation etc. In each of the area, there are ongoing advancement in mathematics itself. Thanks to the advancement, there are many applications of linear algebra in industries such as computer science and engineering, which forms the foundation of the deep learning and machine learning we are studying. In fact, two particular python data science packages, namely numpy and scipy are giving us the power to do most of the computation work in linear algebra. To better understand the output from python data science packages, we can learn how to read the documentation and textbooks in mathematics which then can be translated into Python code that do the hard computation work for us.   \n",
    "\n",
    "With reference to the mathematics book Advanced Engineering Mathematics, we can understand the concept and applications for matrix and vectors. In addition, when we read the documentation from open source python packages, there are assumptions that readers already familiar with the definitions and mathematical symbols, which we need to further verify and update the logical meaning for those symbols and models.\n",
