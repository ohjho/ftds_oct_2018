    "\n",
    "Google created a massive dataset of doodles called quick draw. All of these doodles are avaliable as small 28 by 28 images and can be downloaded from [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap?pli=1). Once you've downloaded a few different images put them in a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to classify the doodles, the rough outline is bellow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read Data into numpy arrays (`np.load`)\n",
    "* Generate the labels and onehot encode them.\n",
    "* Design a neural network to classify the images, just use `Dense` layers for now. The final activation should be softmax, and you will want to use catergorical cross entropy as a loss funuction.\n",
    "* Plot the training accuracy and validation accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "How canan you improve your network? Somethings you can try:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding or remove layers.\n",
    "* Changing the number of neurones in each layer\n",
    "* Adding reuglization either as dropout or to the cost function using L1 or L2 regularization."
