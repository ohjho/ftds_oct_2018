# Recap of Machine Learning

## Preliminary
* Linear Algerba: needed for [dimensionality reduction]
* Calculus: needed for optimisation of which the most common one is [gradient descent]

## Machine Learning
### Tools
* [scikit-learn](): good for most cases
* [azure ML studio](): good for visual understanding of the ML workflow
* [tableau public](): good for Exploratory Data Analysis
### Overfitting the model
### Hyper Parameters tuning
### Bagging vs Boosting

## Deep Learning
* Neural Network
* CNN
* Image Recognition:
  * CNN + ANN
  * layers -> pooling -> flattening -> neural network [[visualized](http://www.scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/flat.html)]
